        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

(She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition.

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

      analysis:
        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",
