        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "Even when the mood dips, you can expect Dua Lipa’s euphoric pop to land back on the bright side eventually. “I’ve always seen the positive side of things, of being able to grow and move forward and change your perspective regardless of what’s happening in your life,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2024. Empowerment for both herself and for other women has always been central to the blockbuster singer-songwriter. Born in London to Kosovar Albanian parents in 1995, Lipa immediately stood out with her 2017 self-titled debut, thanks to the triumphant break-up smash “New Rules”, the self-love anthem “IDGAF” and the assured “Hotter Than Hell”—making it clear that this was no ingénue, but rather an outspoken, effortlessly cool face of pop’s future. Making history as the first female solo artist to receive five BRIT Award nominations, Lipa soon added several Grammy Awards to her mantelpiece and jumped dramatically to the next level with 2020’s Future Nostalgia, a uniting force of positivity released at the dawn of global lockdowns. Her breezy confidence has made her a versatile collaborator with everyone from DJ superstar Calvin Harris to country singer Chris Stapleton, and her Barbie-inspired 2023 hit “Dance the Night” built naturally upon the savvy disco revisionism of Future Nostalgia. By the time of 2024’s Radical Optimism, Lipa had her absolute pick of creative partners—and she chose Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, whom she had fantasised about working with ever since being “completely shook” by Tame’s 2015 opus Currents. Also in the mix were songwriting guns Tobias Jesso Jr. and Caroline Ailin and a timely assemblage of inventive producers. If Radical Optimism is more textured and nuanced than Future Nostalgia, singles like “Houdini” and “Illusion” retain the glide and snap of classic dance pop, while the lyrics probe deeper into her own personal experience. That gives Lipa’s newer material a mounting sense of being forged in the fire of heartbreak and healing, bringing the unmistakable glint of honesty to diva-level pop radiance like “Falling Forever”.",

        "The country world feigned surprise when, after three albums of Music Row-indebted songcraft, Taylor Swift formally embraced pop on 2012’s Red. But no one should have been shocked: Any 14-year-old capable of persuading her parents to move from suburban Pennsylvania to Nashville for her career clearly has ambition to burn. And the thrill of following Swift’s rise has been watching her execute it flawlessly, largely because her melodic intelligence is equal to that ambition. Her early, youthful love songs heralded 2010's newly self-possessed Speak Now—which showed off her scathing wit—and evolved into knowing, ironclad pop fare that held its own against boisterous Max Martin production on 1989, her fifth album, titled after her birth year. Throughout, her songwriting has blurred the lines between the public and private, burying enough real-life clues (about, say, scarves and Starbucks) to make clear that only Swift can own her narrative, thank you very much, while still retaining a lyrical elegance. Though 2017’s reputation might have been perceived as a gorgeously constructed piece of dramatic theatre—its attendant heroes and villains all real-life characters from Swift's public feuds—all that spectacle proved an attention-grabbing cover for her most romantic album yet. She turned up the romance even more on 2019’s Lover, but it was 2020’s folklore and its companion, evermore—ruminative, relatively lo-fi albums written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic—that earned her the Apple Music Award for Songwriter of the Year. She followed those up in 2022 with Midnights, which she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff, and described as the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life. In 2023, Swift undertook one of the most ambitious road shows of all time: the multi-year Eras Tour, which saw her presenting new and classic material across more than 100 locales worldwide. It was just one of many reasons she was named Apple Music's Artist of the Year for 2023. Swift returned to the soft, comfortable, bed-like sonics of Midnights for her 11th album, 2024’s THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. A study in extremes and heightened emotions, the record—which features guest turns from Post Malone and Florence + the Machine—is her most specific, candid and unsparing work to date.",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.”",

        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020.
