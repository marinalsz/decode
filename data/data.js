        "When singer-songwriter Billie Eilish feels something new, the first thing she does is take out her phone and write it down. “You can write anything,” she told Apple Music in an interview for the Up Next series in 2018. “You can say the truth, and you cannot tell anyone that it’s the truth—you can just write it, and it’ll be yours.” Raised and homeschooled in Los Angeles by actor/musician parents, Eilish (born Billie Eilish Pirate Baird O’Connell in 2001) started writing songs when she was around 11, exploring a strain of melancholy, minimal and slightly surrealistic pop influenced as much by Lana Del Rey as the radical honesty of rappers like Tyler, The Creator and Earl Sweatshirt. Writing and recording with her brother—and producer—FINNEAS at their parents’ house, Eilish released dont smile at me in 2017, graduating directly from her bedroom to the spotlight. Hardly two years later, she’d released the Grammys-slaying WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?, an experimental-pop opus exploring mental health and totally upending notions of what constitutes pop music in 2020. (She also won the inaugural Apple Music Award for Global Artist of the Year and performed an Apple Music Live session at London’s O2 Arena in 2022.) Despite the attention, Eilish has done her best to stake out a space of freedom and fluidity, dodging easy definition. Her 2021 album Happier Than Ever saw her chart a further path of self-discovery, after which 2023’s Academy Award-winning ballad “What Was I Made For?” felt downright existential and the 2024 single “LUNCH” openly radiated queer desire. For an artist who has always seemed like she’s whispering closely guarded secrets into our ears, Eilish’s songwriting only seems to be growing more personal. “This is the most ‘me’ thing I’ve ever made,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe about 2024’s HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. “And purely me—not a character.””",

        "Even when the mood dips, you can expect Dua Lipa’s euphoric pop to land back on the bright side eventually. “I’ve always seen the positive side of things, of being able to grow and move forward and change your perspective regardless of what’s happening in your life,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe in 2024. Empowerment for both herself and for other women has always been central to the blockbuster singer-songwriter. Born in London to Kosovar Albanian parents in 1995, Lipa immediately stood out with her 2017 self-titled debut, thanks to the triumphant break-up smash “New Rules”, the self-love anthem “IDGAF” and the assured “Hotter Than Hell”—making it clear that this was no ingénue, but rather an outspoken, effortlessly cool face of pop’s future. Making history as the first female solo artist to receive five BRIT Award nominations, Lipa soon added several Grammy Awards to her mantelpiece and jumped dramatically to the next level with 2020’s Future Nostalgia, a uniting force of positivity released at the dawn of global lockdowns. Her breezy confidence has made her a versatile collaborator with everyone from DJ superstar Calvin Harris to country singer Chris Stapleton, and her Barbie-inspired 2023 hit “Dance the Night” built naturally upon the savvy disco revisionism of Future Nostalgia. By the time of 2024’s Radical Optimism, Lipa had her absolute pick of creative partners—and she chose Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker, whom she had fantasised about working with ever since being “completely shook” by Tame’s 2015 opus Currents. Also in the mix were songwriting guns Tobias Jesso Jr. and Caroline Ailin and a timely assemblage of inventive producers. If Radical Optimism is more textured and nuanced than Future Nostalgia, singles like “Houdini” and “Illusion” retain the glide and snap of classic dance pop, while the lyrics probe deeper into her own personal experience. That gives Lipa’s newer material a mounting sense of being forged in the fire of heartbreak and healing, bringing the unmistakable glint of honesty to diva-level pop radiance like “Falling Forever”.”",

        "The country world feigned surprise when, after three albums of Music Row-indebted songcraft, Taylor Swift formally embraced pop on 2012's Red. But no one should have been shocked, any 14-year-old capable of persuading her parents to move from suburban Pennsylvania to Nashville for her career clearly has ambition to burn. And the thrill of following Swift's rise has been watching her execute it flawlessly, largely because her melodic intelligence is equal to that ambition. Her early, youthful love songs heralded 2010's newly self-possessed Speak Now—which showed off her scathing wit—and evolved into knowing, ironclad pop fare that held its own against boisterous Max Martin production on 1989, her fifth album, titled after her birth year. Throughout, her songwriting has blurred the lines between the public and private, burying enough real-life clues (about, say, scarves and Starbucks) to make clear that only Swift can own her narrative, thank you very much, while still retaining a lyrical elegance. Though 2017's reputation might have been perceived as a gorgeously constructed piece of dramatic theatre—its attendant heroes and villains all real-life characters from Swift's public feuds—all that spectacle proved an attention-grabbing cover for her most romantic album yet. She turned up the romance even more on 2019's Lover, but it was 2020's folklore and its companion, evermore—ruminative, relatively lo-fi albums written and recorded during the COVID-19 pandemic—that earned her the Apple Music Award for Songwriter of the Year. She followed those up in 2022 with Midnights, which she wrote and produced with Jack Antonoff, and described as 'the stories of 13 sleepless nights scattered throughout my life'. In 2023, Swift undertook one of the most ambitious road shows of all time: the multi-year Eras Tour, which saw her presenting new and classic material across more than 100 locales worldwide. It was just one of many reasons she was named Apple Music's Artist of the Year for 2023. Swift returned to the soft, comfortable, bed-like sonics of Midnights for her 11th album, 2024's THE TORTURED POETS DEPARTMENT. A study in extremes and heightened emotions, the record—which features guest turns from Post Malone and Florence + the Machine—is her most specific, candid and unsparing work to date.",

        "Sabrina Carpenter has made the transition from teen-TV star to pop-dominating force look remarkably easy. It helps that the actor and singer-songwriter—born in 1999 in Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania—pursued both sides of her career in tandem, releasing music while establishing a regular presence on the Disney Channel and through other acting gigs, including on Broadway. And on her first two albums—2015’s Eyes Wide Open and 2016’s EVOLution—Carpenter set herself apart from her teenage peers with her deft delivery and her eagerness to embrace plenty of dance music sounds. Singular Act I and Singular Act II—a two-part album that dropped in 2018 and 2019—provided yet more proof of her fast-developing abilities as a singer and songwriter who had moved past teen-star stereotypes to become a full-fledged club powerhouse. Later, Carpenter stepped back sonically to express herself more personally, as on the intimately acoustic “skinny dipping”, from her fifth album, emails i can’t send. Still, the sheer fun of it all has never waned. Just listen to one of the many ad-libbed outros in her live performances of the album’s pop hit “Nonsense”, or indeed the lyrical playfulness of “Espresso”, the flirty funk banger that became summer 2024’s defining hit—and which provided Carpenter’s official breakout moment. Next came the Jack Antonoff-produced “Please Please Please” (which became the summer’s second-biggest hit) and her sixth record Short n’ Sweet, a showcase of the most winking, witty music of Carpenter’s career so far. But if it saw the newly crowned pop princess take aim at past relationships, it also saw her take aim at herself. “A lot of what I really love about this album is the accountability,” she told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I will call myself out just as much as I will call out someone else.”",

        "Charli xcx’s creative drive and willingness to take risks has made her one of the most enthralling pop artists of her era. Whether she’s penning defiantly joyous singles like “Boom Clap” or exploring her glitchier, chaotic side on “Vroom Vroom”, Charli’s success comes from her work both in and out of pop music’s formulaic lane. Born Charlotte Aitchison in 1992 in Cambridge to Scottish and Gujarati Indian parents, she took up songwriting at 14, lifting her stage name from her instant messenger handle. On the strength of her MySpace uploads and performances at London raves, she landed a record deal at 18, released the modestly successful darkwave cuts “Stay Away” and “Nuclear Seasons”, and then hit the big time with 2012’s kiss-off anthem “I Love It”. Originally scrapped from her own album for being too poppy, the beat-pounding re-recording by Swedish duo Icona Pop quickly became a worldwide dance-floor favourite. Her goth-tinged debut album, 2013’s True Romance, and tracks like the psychedelic, Gold Panda-sampling “You (Ha Ha Ha)” soon positioned Charli as the missing link between Grimes’ freak scene, Lorde’s dark melodies and Carly Rae Jepsen’s sweetness. But while that album and its follow-up, 2014’s synth-poppy Sucker, brought Charli a few steps closer to mainstream approval, she found more creative freedom among the esoteric, hyperpop wilds of 2016’s Vroom Vroom EP and 2017’s twin mixtapes, Number 1 Angel and Pop 2. While stardom eluded her, Charli built a track record as a prolific songwriter and collaborator, penning standard pop hits for Iggy Azalea (“Fancy”) and Selena Gomez (“Same Old Love”), and working with the likes of Lil Yachty, David Guetta and BTS. Yet Charli shines brightest when she’s illuminating, breaking down and even critiquing the industry that gives her acclaim. In 2020, a year after the release of her eclectic, star-studded third album, Charli, she released the intimate how i’m feeling now, an album written in six weeks during the pandemic with input from fans alongside extensive, real-time video diaries and notes. Two years later, she experimented with the act of selling out on her fourth album, CRASH, using her major record label’s A&R expertise to write the mainstream pop record she’d always been afraid to release. That album’s success, coupled with a prominent feature (“Speed Drive”) on 2023’s blockbuster Barbie soundtrack, brought Charli closer than ever to worldwide appeal. But her response was to turn back to the sounds that inspired her to make music in the first place. Her 2024 album, BRAT, is a homage to those riotous, sweaty London clubs of her youth, and an introspective—if not slightly ironic—look at her pop music journey, one riddled with head-empty euphoria (“Club classics”), dominating swagger (“Von dutch”) and sombre sentimentality (“I think about it all the time”).",

        "The Colombian singer-songwriter KAROL G has kicked doors open for women in reggaetón and Latin trap—without breaking a single perfectly manicured nail. Born Carolina Giraldo Navarro in Medellín in 1991, she was obsessed with music from age 5, following in the footsteps of her musician father. She released her first single at 16 and went on to study music at the University of Antioquia. But despite a turn on El Factor X in 2010 and numerous backing gigs, she couldn’t seem to move beyond supporting roles—doors slammed whenever she, as a woman, tried to get ahead in the male-dominated world of reggaetón. Frustrated, she moved to New York City to study English, but she couldn’t bury her musical ambitions. While there, she resolved to become both an artist and a savvy businesswoman. She returned to Medellín, singing covers and sharing them online while seeking new opportunities. Her renewed focus paid off: she signed to Universal Latino in 2016. Her 2017 collaboration with Bad Bunny, “Ahora Me Llama”, blew up, setting the stage for the Latin trap masterpiece Unstoppable, an album that established her as both an excellent singer and a rapper with a cool and collected flow that calls to mind greats like Spain’s Mala Rodríguez. Collaborations with Nicki Minaj and Quavo ensued, and 2019’s follow-up, Ocean, saw KAROL G branching out with next-level trap, sinuous dance music and persuasive ballads, cementing her as one of Latin music’s most versatile and talented artists. She only continued to prove her staying power and cross-cultural appeal in the years to come, collaborating with Ludacris on 2021's KG0516 and FINNEAS and Shakira on 2023's MAÑANA SERÁ BONITO.”",

        "Tyla creates music that is at once indelibly South African and ambitiously global. It’s a unique balance, one moulded by the sounds she heard as a child growing up in Johannesburg. Not only did Tyla (born in 2002) listen to plenty of homegrown music, including Kwaito and Afropop, but she was also exposed to ’90s American R&B greats like Aaliyah and Brandy. As with so many artists coming of age in the 21st century, the motivated teenager utilised social media to showcase her swiftly evolving talent; she then teamed up with South African producer Kooldrink for “Getting Late”. The 2019 single is a mesmerising realisation of Tyla’s love for bridging styles. The killer rhythm track is rooted in amapiano, and the singer’s translucent vocals reveal stunning versatility: hypnotic enough for dance music yet packed with pop’s effortless catchiness and R&B’s undiluted soulfulness.Tyla swirled all of those elements together seamlessly for Tyla, her 2024 eponymous debut that crystallised her status as an emerging global superstar. Powered by the irresistible 'Water', not to mention the Gunna- and Skillibeng-aided 'Jump', the project proved her ability to unite people and genres on the global embassy of the dance floor. ”",

        "Armed with a mesmerising, nimble soprano—and a vocal register often likened to those of Mariah Carey and Christina Aguilera—Ariana Grande began her career as a child star on Broadway and Nickelodeon before transforming into a pop and R&B powerhouse. Instantly recognisable thanks to her signature ponytail and breezy self-confidence, Grande, born in Florida in 1993, has developed a slyly sexual personal brand that has, like that of the Spice Girls before her, become an iconic image of young female power. But Grande is more than a symbol: over the course of several albums and scores of hit singles across the genre spectrum—beginning with 2013’s R&B crooner “The Way” (featuring Mac Miller) and continuing through to an EDM collab with Zedd (“Break Free”), slinky retro-soul (“Dangerous Woman”) and diva trap-pop (“7 rings”)—she has consistently outshined her male collaborators and deftly parlayed her stardom into activism. An LGBTQ+ advocate and outspoken feminist, she has long used her platform to confront misogyny, sexism, homophobia and bullying, spreading a message of love over all. Her Max Martin-produced smash “no tears left to cry”, an escapist dance-floor triumph released a year after a deadly terrorist attack at one of her concerts in 2017, and its subsequent album, Sweetener, sent a message of hope and healing, with a dose of hear-me-roar attitude. Grande’s pop vision has since focused inward, using music as a therapeutic tool for spiritual growth. After experiencing a devastating personal loss with the death of ex-boyfriend Mac Miller in 2018, she re-emerged with 2019’s thank u, next, an elegiac album that was as therapeutic as it was dance-ready, with a title track that sends off ex-lovers with a gentle kiss on the cheek. The following year’s pandemic-written Positions highlights Grande’s mellifluous vocals and her desire to be content in love—even when boasting about her sexual prowess (as on the cheeky “34+35”), the real star of her heart is her own self. And on her lush, auto-fictitious 2024 concept album, eternal sunshine, she glides with a coy smile and a heavenly whistle through the emotions of a woman betrayed, perceived and adored, with a short wave to critics and tabloids on the pulsing house groove of “yes, and?””",

Born in 2003 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, she worked her way up to the finals on So You Think You Can Dance at age 13, following other impressive milestones as a live performer. McRae answered her overnight TV success by uploading a series of singles that showcased the preternatural depth of her singing and songwriting. Signed to a major label when she was 16, she struck gold globally with 2020’s “you broke me first”, adding ominous trap beats to an intimate lament. But rather than be pigeonholed by weepy ballads, McRae quickly showcased her full range with convincing forays into dreamy alt-rock and purring R&B on 2022’s i used to think i could fly. Coming off even more emboldened on 2023’s THINK LATER, she greets her entry into her twenties with a well-earned sense of confidence on tracks like the chirping kiss-off “exes”. Echoing her penchant for inhabiting a deep bench of musical styles without breaking her stride, she seems just as much at home in the role of a nonchalant heartbreaker as in the role of the one at home nursing a broken heart.”",

        "ROSALÍA may be a flamenco singer, but her favourite musicians are those who have carved out new niches for themselves—artists like James Blake, Billie Eilish and Frank Ocean. That’s no accident. Like them, she flouts genre conventions while exploring silence and space as much as sound—and she’s remade flamenco and pop in the process. Rosalia Vila Tobella was born in 1992 into a non-musical family in Sant Cugat del Vallès, Spain. She began singing and dancing at age 9. “I always felt that this is my path, that I had to do music, that I couldn’t do anything else in life,” she told Apple Music in 2018. Fortunately, her family supported her ambitions: she began training as a flamenco singer at 13, and in 2017, at age 23, she released her first album, Los Ángeles, an extraordinary, spare set of traditional flamenco featuring just her voice and guitarist Raül Refree. But ROSALÍA had devoured hip-hop and R&B as voraciously as flamenco while growing up, and her 2018 breakthrough concept album, EL MAL QUERER, saw her demolish the barriers between those genres. Working with friend and producer El Guincho, she found a way to interweave flamenco with electronic music with authenticity and integrity. Her extraordinary voice has led a growing procession of artists, including Travis Scott and J Balvin, to line up for collaborations.”",

        "For FLETCHER, songwriting is an act of radical vulnerability—a way to share her truth unapologetically. “I write what I need to say but can’t always find the words to speak,” she told Rolling Stone in 2020. Born Cari Elise Fletcher in 1994 and raised in Asbury Park, New Jersey, the singer grew up immersed in music, drawing early inspiration from the emotional storytelling of artists like Alanis Morissette and the boldness of modern pop icons. Her breakout moment came in 2019 with “Undrunk,” a raw and relatable anthem about heartbreak that showcased her knack for blending confessional lyrics with sleek, contemporary pop production. The song catapulted her into the spotlight, earning her widespread acclaim for its honesty and vulnerability. Across EPs like you ruined new york city for me and THE S(EX) TAPES, FLETCHER has built a reputation for exploring themes of self-discovery, love, and queerness with fearless authenticity. Her music often feels like an intimate diary entry, unfiltered and deeply personal, resonating with fans who see their own experiences reflected in her work. “I want my music to make people feel less alone,” she shared in a 2021 interview. “To know that it’s okay to feel messy and complicated.” On stage, FLETCHER’s magnetic presence and powerhouse vocals bring her songs to life, creating a space where vulnerability is celebrated and connection thrives. As she continues to evolve, FLETCHER has solidified her status as one of pop’s most exciting voices, blending emotional depth with undeniable hooks and a bold, unapologetic perspective.”",

        "Combining the vocal structures of American folk music with the hypnotic rhythms of 21st-century electro-pop, Maggie Rogers blazed her own trail through pop to become a festival fixture in the late 2010s. Born in Maryland in 1994, Rogers immersed herself in music as a child; she won a Berklee College of Music songwriting contest in school, and she attended NYU’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music. When that school’s artist-in-residence Pharrell Williams heard her final project—the skeletal yet deeply felt song “Alaska”—he was moved to tears, and the viral video footage of his reaction became Rogers’ introduction to pop fans. She released the EP Now That the Light Is Fading in 2017, following that up in 2019 with her major-label debut, Heard It In A Past Life, which expanded Rogers’ sound through collaborations with top-tier producers like Greg Kurstin and Rostam Batmanglij. Subsequently, Rogers toured the world, playing festivals, headlining a tour and opening for HAIM, Kacey Musgraves and Mumford & Sons; she also collaborated on stage and on record with the likes of The National, Phoebe Bridgers and Dead & Company. In December 2020 she opened her vaults and released the retrospective Notes from the Archive: Recordings 2011-2016, which showcased her classically modern songwriting in its most natural state.”",

        "“I’m the biggest emo drama queen,” Olivia Rodrigo (born in 2003 in Murrieta, California) told Apple Music. But the key to letting it out is keeping it together, and balancing that tension has been key to the onetime High School Musical: The Musical: The Series star, who quickly established herself as one of pop’s next-generation leaders and has since proved herself adept at combining the twist-filled, sonically dense music of ’90s alt-rock with unabashed emotionalism.Rodrigo was just 17 when her first post-Disney hit, the weepy “drivers license”, took over pop at the beginning of 2021, but she had been getting ready for years, taking lessons in piano, voice and acting as a child. A few months later, Rodrigo released her debut album, SOUR, a breakup record with a meticulous rage: “Where’s my fucking teenage dream?” she wondered on 'brutal', the album's Elastica-recalling opener. Whatever dreams she had during its genesis were vivid, as evidenced by lyrics that zero in on the details: an ex singing along to Billy Joel with his new love (the swirling “deja vu”); reading said ex’s self-help books “so you’d think that I was smart” (the stripped-down “enough for you”). GUTS, which followed in 2023, built on SOUR, with Rodrigo (and her producer and collaborator Dan Nigro) placing her pointillistic lyrics in an expanded sonic palette that incorporated influences from off-kilter ’90s acts like The Breeders (the illicit-thrill chronicle “bad idea right?”) and Butthole Surfers (the loose-limbed “get him back!”). While Rodrigo’s roots are in teen pop, her emotions—and her songs’ hooks—are relatable for listeners of all ages.”",

        "Los Angeles singer/songwriter Gracie Abrams has a talent for cutting to the quick. A song about a breakup’s messy aftermath, “21” opens bluntly with the line: “I missed your 21st birthday.” Another song about finding it hard to move on revolves around the simple admission, “I miss you, I’m sorry.” Abrams’ swift incisions are particularly notable given that her father is director J.J. Abrams, whose television series Lost boasted such ingeniously convoluted plotlines. Born in 1999, the Los Angeles native grew up listening to Joni Mitchell and Elliott Smith, but it wasn’t until she discovered Phoebe Bridgers, at age 13, that she began writing her own songs. She wrote “minor”—about a crush who lived too far away for her to visit before curfew—at age 17. “It was the first time that I’d written a song where I felt like I wasn’t trying to emulate someone else’s sound,” she tells Apple Music. Even Abrams’ early singles display a wisdom beyond her years. Released when she was 20, “21” revolves around the devastating line, “You’ll be the love of my life when I was young”—an elegant example of her knack for turning an idea as simple as “young love” into a complex meditation on life’s changes. “Looking back is unattractive to me,” she acknowledges, yet while preparing her first long-form statement—2020’s minor—she realised she needed to reflect to move forward. “Thinking about what that meant and how the songs needed to exist together,” she says, the experience of writing “minor” as a teen never went away. “It was always in the back of my head. I didn’t want to run away from it.””",

In early 2020 she connected with producer Dan Nigro, and that April she released “Pink Pony Club”, a torchy ballad about thriving at “a special place/where boys and girls can all be queens every single day”. Roan released a smattering of singles, including the writhing “My Kink Is Karma” and the yearning “Casual”, before putting out her first full-length, The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess, in September 2023. Roan’s unbridled, lusty pop songs became an online phenomenon—or, as she might put it, a “femininomenon”—and she hit the arena circuit when she opened for Olivia Rodrigo on the latter’s GUTS tour in early 2024.”",

        "Solána Rowe had a weird time growing up. Jersey suburbs, orthodox Muslim household, parents working their way through corporate America, wanted to fit in, couldn’t. She got bullied for wearing a hijab after 9/11 and became the kind of teenager who, on at least one occasion, drew the police into a chase while joyriding in the family car. “[My parents] were only strict because they were reasonable,” she told Apple Music in 2017. “Like, they’re Black, they come from the South and Midwest, they don’t come from anything…they’re not tryna take a gang of risks.” That Rowe had her own ideas about how to live didn’t help. “I rebelled really hard, and I learned everything the hard way,” she said. “I’m very hard-headed, very curious.” It’s a balance—rebellious but insecure, expressive but self-conscious, dreamy but alert—that has made Rowe resonant, but also an anomaly, the kind of artist who doesn’t ignore her quirks or contradictions, but brings them to the table in all their messy human glory. After self-releasing a couple of EPs in her early twenties (she took her name from the Nation of Islam’s Supreme Alphabet—Savior Zig-Zag Allah), she became the first female artist signed to Top Dawg Entertainment, joining future collaborators Kendrick Lamar and Jay Rock. Released in 2017, her debut album, Ctrl, put her at the vanguard of contemporary R&B, mixing the expressivity of classic soul with a hazy, synth-heavy atmosphere and a playful sense of lyricism that brought Rowe’s inner monologue out. “Even with the heels and tighter clothes and other things, I’m still just me,” she said. “I still have a lot of anxiety about the world, and my thoughts and what people think about my thoughts.” Following a five-year gap, SZA returned in 2022 with SOS, an album that crystallised her status as one of the most dynamic and commercially dominant singer-songwriters of her era. Coated in an eclectic mix of hip-hop, R&B, folk, electronica and more, the second LP finds SZA tackling imperfect love, with tracks like the No. 3 hit 'Kill Bill' and the Grammy-winning 'Snooze' embodying the type of songwriting that can be as ironic as it is heartfelt—a trademark for artists that turn emotional chaos into idiosyncratic grace. Her Apple Music Live session, performed at Brooklyn's Barclays Center, was broadcast in January 2024.”",

        "Some may dismiss pop as inauthentic. But for Lady Gaga—one of popular culture’s greatest, most extravagant creations—the inauthenticity is the point. No artist has more defiantly embodied that provocation this century than the one born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta (in New York in 1986). Never wedded to the same image—her most memorable looks (among many) have included a gown fashioned from raw meat, a red-carpet-appropriate pair of dish gloves and “the world’s first flying dress”—Gaga personifies pop’s surface obsessions while simultaneously upending them. In a sense, her creative identity had crystallised by age 21; she’d been a child pianist, aspiring actor and burlesque performer. Each of these facets powered her career’s most distinct parts: the celebrity fascination of her first two albums, 2008’s The Fame and 2009’s The Fame Monster; the subversive layering of 2011’s Born This Way and 2013’s ARTPOP; the sincere reverence of 2014’s Cheek to Cheek, her jazz standards album with Tony Bennett; the rootsier songwriting of 2016’s Joanne; and 2020’s jubilant return to her neon-hued electro roots, Chromatica. If the 2009 smash “Paparazzi” reveled in the flashes, then “Born This Way” celebrated inner light: in translating her diffuse identity into world-conquering art, Gaga has become a beacon to anyone else who’s felt like an outsider. Her loyal following of Little Monsters have affirmed a deep connection to her message of self-love and self-expression, despite pop’s fickleness and her chameleonic exterior. She played out a simpler version of her path to fame in the Oscar-worthy 2018 remake of A Star Is Born. But while her character’s ascent was abetted by her lover, Gaga’s was all her own.”",

        "Kehlani Parrish has become one of the most grounded, inspiring voices in modern R&B, preaching messages of self-care and sexual fluidity in ways that feel frank, funny and real. Born in Oakland, California, in 1995, they embarked on a solo career after leaving the teen-pop group Poplyfe. Since then, they have proven to be a master of contrasts across a series of mixtapes and albums that match heartfelt revelations with an increasing degree of futuristic musical and production flourishes. Collaborations ramped up their star power in a big way, with Kehlani thriving opposite the likes of Chance the Rapper, G-Eazy, Charlie Puth and Ty Dolla $ign. Following the induction into parenthood tackled on 2020’s It Was Good Until It Wasn’t and the overt healing themes of 2022’s blue water road, they took a more empowering turn on 2024’s CRASH. “For once, I’m not attached to some story or some public thing or some trauma or some deep explanations,” Kehlani told Apple Music’s Zane Lowe. “I have nothing but joyful things to say to you. I’m in such a happy place.” The songs on CRASH were also specifically designed to be performed live, giving them a spontaneous edge. That heightens the tender offer of romantic communion on both the percolating “After Hours” and the country-leaning ballad “Better Not”. By contrast, Kehlani reminds us of their enduring swagger on the Christina Aguilera-sampling “What I Want”, a brash statement of female desire. Through it all, their authenticity rings out loud and clear.”",

        "For Lola Índigo, music and dance are inseparable—a perfect union that transforms her performances into electrifying spectacles. “I’ve always felt like music needs to be lived through movement,” she shared in a 2020 interview. Born Miriam Doblas in Madrid, Spain, in 1992, and raised in Granada, her journey to stardom began as a dancer, honing her craft on international stages before finding her voice as a singer. Lola Índigo first captured public attention as a contestant on Operación Triunfo in 2017, but it was her debut single “Ya No Quiero Ná” that solidified her place as one of Spain’s most dynamic pop artists. Combining urban beats with reggaeton rhythms, her music is unapologetically fun and fiercely empowering, resonating with a generation eager to break free from convention. Her albums, such as Akelarre and La Niña, showcase her ability to merge infectious hooks with powerful feminist messages. Known for her bold visuals and choreography, Lola Índigo has redefined the role of a pop star in Spain, blending music, fashion, and performance art into a seamless expression of her creativity. “Every song I release is a piece of my story,” she said in a 2022 interview. “But more than that, it’s a chance to connect with people who feel like they don’t fit in and give them a reason to dance.” Her work as both an artist and a dancer has made her a pioneer in modern Spanish pop, pushing the boundaries of what it means to be a performer. With her captivating stage presence and genre-blurring sound, Lola Índigo has established herself as a force to be reckoned with, bringing vibrant energy and authenticity to every project she undertakes.”",

        "Nigerian singer Tems crafts weighty songs that manage to float, with velvety vocals that unfurl through lyrics imbued with emotional depth. They have made her a leader in Nigeria’s alté music movement, which blends Afrobeats, alternative R&B, hip-hop, and dancehall. Born Temilade Openiyi in 1995 in Lagos, the former Apple Music Up Next artist knew she was destined to make music. At age 6, Tems was creating original songs; at 13, she began vocal training. “By the time I was 17, I knew that this was the only thing that I could possibly do in life,” she told Apple Music. In 2018, her first single, the revelatory “Mr Rebel”, was an immediate runaway hit. Her appearance on fellow Nigerian Wizkid’s beloved 2020 single “Essence” increased Tems’ visibility and brought more attention to her debut EP, For Broken Ears. Led by the undulating “Free Mind”, the project cemented Tems as a rising star not only throughout Africa but worldwide. In 2021, she released her follow-up, If Orange Was a Place, which was highlighted by the Brent Faiyaz-assisted “Found”. An emotive guest feature on Future’s 2022 single “Wait for You” has kept Tems in the spotlight—but she remains grounded by her experiences. “At every single point in my life, I’ve had to break out,” she said. “I’ve had to break boundaries completely. Being yourself, it takes more courage than people would imagine.””",

Born in Estepona, Spain, in 1997, Mena grew up steeped in Mediterranean sounds, blending pop influences with traditional Spanish music. Her career began in the spotlight as a teenager, appearing in television competitions and acting roles before her undeniable charisma drew her to the world of music. Mena’s breakout came with the release of singles like “Ahora Lloras Tú” and “Se Iluminaba,” collaborations that cemented her status as one of Latin pop’s brightest stars. Her ability to fuse urban rhythms with infectious melodies earned her acclaim across Europe and Latin America, making her a sought-after collaborator with artists like Rocco Hunt, Fred De Palma, and Becky G. “I love collaborating because every time I do, I learn something new,” she said in a 2022 interview. Known for her vibrant energy and emotive delivery, Mena balances the exuberance of dance tracks with the tenderness of heartfelt ballads, often singing in both Spanish and Italian. Her multilingual approach has allowed her to connect with diverse audiences, creating a bridge between cultures through her music. In recent years, Ana Mena has continued to evolve as an artist, exploring deeper themes while keeping her signature sunny sound. “I always want my music to feel alive,” she said in a 2023 interview. “Whether it makes you dance or makes you cry, it should always make you feel.” With her unique ability to channel joy and passion, Mena remains one of the most exciting voices in contemporary Latin pop.”",

        "Singer-songwriter Clairo brought viewers straight into her teenage bedroom with the slapdash video for her 2017 lo-fi breakthrough, “Pretty Girl”. The song, built on a simple keyboard riff and drum beat, is tongue-in-cheek but deep in its relationship analysis, while the video shows her in all her greasy-haired, half-awake glory. To Clairo, who was eventually named an Up Next artist by Apple Music, this sort of intimacy and vulnerability is what music is all about: “There’s no point in making a record if it isn’t personal,” she told Apple Music. As far as the sound itself, the artist, born Claire Cottrill in 1998, was exposed to a wide range of musical influences as a kid—Al Green from her dad and Cocteau Twins from her mum. By age 13, she was recording and performing covers, and eventually started playing DIY university shows near her parents’ home outside Boston. Soon after “Pretty Girl” and songs like the woozy, synth-soaked meditation “Flaming Hot Cheetos” started racking up streams, Clairo teamed up with former Vampire Weekend star Rostam, who co-produced her 2019 full-length debut, Immunity. Led by airy guitar-pop confessions “Bags” and “Sofia”, the album preserves her homespun charm while upping the indie rock fuzz, soulful grooves and throbbing electro beats. Through it all, Clairo’s warm, hushed vocals make it feel like she’s sharing her deepest, darkest secrets just with you.”",
